A good morning exercise is a hip hinge movement that helps strengthen your butt and legs by targeting your back, hamstrings, glutes, and adductors.
When done right, a good morning workout is effective for strengthening your back and making it more flexible. However, if you have just started, it is recommended to try the movement with empty weight.
