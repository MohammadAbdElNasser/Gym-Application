45 Degree incline row is a effective exercise that effectively works many muscles, including the lateral deltoid, posterior deltoid, back and trapezius muscles. It also activates the trapezius muscles, and may benefit discomfort caused by muscle weakness such as postural posture and shoulder blade protrusion by affecting the infraspinatus and subscapula muscles that cover the scapula.
