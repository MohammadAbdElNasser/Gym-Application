Front and back tate press exercise is a bidirectional tricep exercise that effectively targets the triceps and also works the upper chest and front heads of the shoulders. Working the triceps at different angles will benefit muscle development and strength, but due to the angle and position of the elbows, it will be more beneficial to work the Tate Press at light to medium weights.
