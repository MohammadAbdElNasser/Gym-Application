Dumbbell triceps extension is an isolation exercise. The main benefit of the dumbbell triceps extension is the hypertrophy of the triceps that comes with the motion. Dumbbell triceps extension activates all three heads of the triceps, which means your entire triceps will be strengthened and developed with this exercise.
