A variation of the dumbbell bench press, the first goal of this exercise is to build the chest and triceps muscles. Close-grip dumbbell presses work your entire chest, with a slight emphasis on your inner pecs. But when it comes to a close-grip dumbbell press, the focus is shifted to the tricep muscles. It helps in activating the inner chest and increases the tricep strength.
