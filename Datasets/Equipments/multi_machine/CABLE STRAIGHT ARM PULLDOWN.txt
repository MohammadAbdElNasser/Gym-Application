The straight-arm pulldown exercise is a variation of the classic lat-pulldown. Keeping the arms straight prevents the mid-back and biceps from taking over the movement, so you can focus on the lat muscles youâ€™re trying to work more directly.
Having a strong back helps to keep the spinal column in proper alignment and allows for completion of everyday tasks with reduced injury risk. In addition to helping strengthen the back, the exercise secondarily works the triceps and shoulders.
