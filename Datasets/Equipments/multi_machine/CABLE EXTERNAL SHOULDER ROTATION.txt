The shoulder muscle consists of 3 parts. These; anterior deltoid, lateral deltoid and posterior deltoid muscles. Besides these large muscles, there are 4 more muscles to consider. These muscles are called rotator cuff muscles. These muscles are like columns under the building! The stronger the columns, the more earthquake resistant the building. The shoulder muscles are just like that, the stronger the muscles that support it, the stronger the shoulder muscles. One of the causes of shoulder pain and shoulder injuries in sports is to overload the shoulder muscles without strengthening these muscles
Rotation exercises are exercises designed to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles connected to the shoulder muscles. Strengthening your rotator cuff muscles with these exercises before shoulder training is beneficial for your shoulder health.
To makeover the entire muscle for better muscle balance and joint stability, you have to work it through a full range of motion. Performing shoulder exercises designed to strengthen the muscles as well as to improve the shoulder range of motion will reduce the stress on the joint making it less susceptible to joint inflammations like tendinitis and bursitis.
